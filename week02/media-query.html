            <p>
                Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked or stand in the way that sinners take or
                sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord, and who meditates on his law
                day and night. That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season
                and whose leaf does not witherâ€”whatever they do prospers.
